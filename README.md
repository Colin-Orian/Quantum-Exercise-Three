# Quantum-Exercise-Three

For this exercise, I took the data set created from: https://qiskit.org/documentation/machine-learning/tutorials/03_quantum_kernel.html and used Pennylane's Data-Reuploading Classifer tutorial (https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_data_reuploading_classifier.html) to classify the dataset.
